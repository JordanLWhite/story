Jimmy couldn't wait to go to school Tuesday morning, but he would never be able to expect what waited for him there. Jimmy's mommy made him special pancakes that morning and he ate them with a smile on his face. The End. Oh, wait there was also bacon and the pancakes was Belgian, yeah, Belgian pancakes.
