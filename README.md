# story


Jimmy couldn't wait to go to school Tuesday morning, but he would never be able to expect what waited for him there. Jimmy's mommy made him special pancakes that morning and he ate them with a smile on his face. The End. Oh, wait there was also bacon and the pancakes were Belgian, yeah, Belgian pancakes. I guess it's not the end of the story, as you can't end a story with bacon and Belgian pancakes.
